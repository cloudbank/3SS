# 3SS Â©
An Android dhash algorithm that does reduction, greyscale, and fingerprint in one pass. Currently written to detect  duplicates with box interpolation.  While it does work when I download a large enough image (100 x 100), NN does not hold up with less pixel information, for distortions.
I plan to try Haar wavelet or sinc lanczos now that it is working across colorize changes.
I am researching reworking the whole algorithm in [3SS2B](https://github.com/cloudbank/3SS2B/) for other possibilities such as FMIQ and Deep Autoencoders. 

Available in C++ and Kotlin.


3SS describes the 3 steps of the dhash algorithm in one pass for image detection, optimized for use with Android(row hash only, DirectBuffer to JNI or Kotlin implementation). It is using NN for scaling with exact detection.  It is currently working on complex images with box  interpolation and these shortcuts.

## Best times for hashing, so far:

* JNI C++ nativeDHash: ~1.7s avg

* Kotlin dHash: 1 sec
